# Task List with Login System and Db Storage

### FYI

 All packages used are listed in the package.json. Some of this code was taken from a 6 part MIT tutorial series that I have been following over the semester. I modified it and added the necessary code to fit the requirements for the project.

 I also wanted to have a finished project that I could add to my portfolio as I am looking for a full-time job. 


### Usage


### Installation
